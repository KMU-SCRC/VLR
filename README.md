# KMU-SCRC VLR

We are researching Underwater Wireless Communication for Advanced Diver Network (ADN).

This program supports a roaming service in an underwater network and manages a diver's movement, running on a surface gateway.

It updates Visitor Location Register (VLR) of the gateway with a diver's signal.

It can be applied to provide a lot of services connected to a terrestrial communication network.



# Quickstart

```
1. Input an IP address of Home Location Register (HLR) you want to access.
2. Input a device's ID.
3. Input an authorization key. (*Initial Key: ASDN9989)
```

Then you can complete accessing HLR.

```
4. Input START and Port Number of a connected device.
```

Then you can see a confirmation of starting UART communication.

If you want to see other functions in detail, type HELP.
